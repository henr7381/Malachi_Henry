This is a modular hobby grade server rack to house all my networking related hardware. It is home to my router and switch which I have configured to my liking, two single board computers (one of which hosts my network drive), power distribution for the SBCs, the SSD for the network drive, and power distribution for the SBC fans. It works great, and still has room to add another switch, SBC, more SSDs, etc.
